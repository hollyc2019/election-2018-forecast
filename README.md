# election-2018-forecast

November 6, 2018

I predict that the Republicans will lose the House, but keep the Senate (narrowly). I predict they will gain 23 seats in the House based on how people are betting in the market (PredictIt - a NZ based political predictions market).

I think a lot of people are rallying to the polls for this particular election given the group of upset (majority) voters during the 2016 Presidential Campaign, social media and celebrities posting about it, and the group of people who are unsatisfied with how President Trump has performed during his term.
